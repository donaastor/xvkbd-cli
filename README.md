# xvkbd-cli
This should be a fork or something of xvkbd project, but I can't figure out how to link it properly, so here it is: http://t-sato.in.coocan.jp/xvkbd/
The difference:<br>
&emsp;&emsp;1. Files that are missing are deleted completely<br>
&emsp;&emsp;2. I deleted some lines from these 4 files:<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;1.  .<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;2.  .<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;3.  .<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;4.  .<br>
How to install:
&emsp;&emsp;mkdir /tmp/i-love-you
&emsp;&emsp;cd /tmp/i-love-you
&emsp;&emsp;git clone https://github.com/donaastor/xvkbd-cli.git
&emsp;&emsp;makepkg -esi
