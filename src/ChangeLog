Version 0.1 (2000-05-13)

 - The first release, not announced anywhere.

Version 0.2 (2000-09-15)

 - Compose key is added.  In the environments where Compose key
   is supported, some characters (mainly letters with accent
   symbol) which can't be entered directly from keyboard can be
   entered using dedicated key combinations.

 - Make keyboard layout not to be disturbed when window size if
   specified with -geometry option.

 - Sample app-defaults file is added.

Version 0.3 (2000-10-05)

 - -text option can now accept some modifiers (\S, \C, etc.) and
   any keysyms (\[keysym]).

 - In addition to the window ID, -window option can now accept
   window name.

 - New -widget option to specify the widget to set the input
   focus.

Version 1.0 (2000-11-03)

 - Keyboard layout can be now configured with resources.  See
   "Customizing Keyboard Layout" above, and XVkbd-german.ad in
   the distribution.

 - xvkbd can now send keys with Mode_switch (AltGr) modifier,
   which enables those characters in the position to be entered.

 - xvkbd now support AltGr key so that German (and some other)
   keyboard layout can be used.  See XVkbd-german.ad in the
   distribution.

 - XVkbd-german and XVkbd-latin1 are included in the distribution,
   which modifies keyboard layout and put some non-ASCII keys on
   the xvkbd window.

 - CapsLock key is supported now.

Version 1.1 (2000-12-23)

 - xvkbd can now use XTEST extension to simulate keyboard events.
   It can still use XSendEvent(), as it was in the older release.
   (thanks, Bjoern)

 - Labels on keys can now be set independently for each of four
   shift states, not shifted, Shift, AltGr and Shift-AltGr.
   (thanks, Jim)

 - -kterm option and xvkbd.kterm resource are removed.

Version 1.2 (2001-02-18)

 - Focus button is now placed in the main keyboard, too, so that
   it will be available also in compact mode.  If you don't need
   it, it can be removed by setting ``xvkbd*row5.Focus.width:
   1''.

 - Input focus set by Focus button can now be cleard by clicking
   Focus button twice.  Clicking Focus button with mouse button 3
   will still clear the input focus, too.

 - Text can now be assigned to function keys (and, actually, to
   most other keys).

 - It is now possible to assign keys modified with Shift,
   Control, Alt and Meta on the main keyboard, by putting `s:',
   `c:', `a:' and `m:' before those keysym name when customizing
   the keyboard layout.

 - xvkbd now ignores SIGINT and SIGQUIT so that it will not
   terminated accidently.

Version 1.3 (2001-03-19)

 - New app-defaults file for Swiss-German layout,
   XVkbd-swissgerman.ad.  (contributed from Marcel Portner)

 - xvkbd now catches MappingNotify event and reload the new
   mapping.  This allows users to use xmodmap while xvkbd is
   running.

 - NumLock key is supported now.  (I'd removed Print, ScrLk and
   Pause from keypad - somebody need them?)

Version 1.4 (2001-04-22)

 - Auto-repeat didn't work when focus was set explicitly via
   Focus button.  It is now fixed.

 - When required keysym was not defined in the keymap table,
   xvkbd will now add it on-the-fly.  This means that we don't
   have to add them via xmodmap.

 - Keypad panel can now be popped up from the main keyboard as a
   separate window.

 - Sun function keys is now supported.  It can be popped up from
   the main keyboard as a separate window.

 - Manual page is now available.

Version 1.5 (2001-10-08)

 - Key events can now be sent to windows on a remote display
   (i.e. windows on other X servers) - use "Connect to Remote
   Display..." in the main menu to connect to remote display.

 - Shift, Control, Alt and Meta can now be locked - use "Lock
   Shift?" and "Lock Control, Alt and Meta?"  in the main menu.
   Those initial settings can be set by xvkbd.shiftLock and
   xvkbd.modifiersLock resource.

 - If the first keysym for a key is an alphabet and the second
   keysym is NoSymbol, it is now interpreted as if the first
   keysym is lowercase alphabet and the second keysym is
   upper-case alphabet.  Keymap may be defined in this way in
   some systems including Solaris, and older xvkbd may not work
   correctly in such situation.

Version 1.6 (2001-11-10)

 - New `-file' option to send characters in the specified file.
   (thanks, Gregory)

 - New entry `Use XTEST Extension?' is added to the main menu,
   mainly to indicate the availability of the XTEST extension.

 - xvkbd would crash when the window explicitly focused via Focus
   button becomes was destroyed.  This problem is now fixed.

Version 2.0 (2001-12-09)

 - Keyboard layout (default, German, French, etc.) can now be
   changed after xvkbd is invoked.

 - Show/hide of the keypad and funcion keys on the main window
   can now be toggled from the main menu.

 - New app-defaults file for French layout, XVkbd-french.ad.
   (contributed from Jean-Pierre Demailly)

Version 2.1 (2002-01-27)

 - When height of the xvkbd window is smaller than
   XVkbd.modalThreshold, xvkbd will now automatically switch the
   keytop as if -modal option was specified.

 - \[keysym] in -text option would send wrong keys - this problem
   is now fixed.

 - Target distclean in the Imakefile is renamed to avoid the pos-
   sible confusion on some systems.

 - Word completion is now supported.

Version 2.2 (2002-03-17)

 - String assigned to function keys can now be edited on a panel
   popped up via "Edit Function Keys..." in the main menu.

 - When ``-'' was specified as the filename parameter for -file
   option, xvkbd will now read its standard input (stdin) to get
   the string to be sent.

 - In the previous release, less-portable setenv() function was
   used instead of putenv() function, may cause compilation error
   on some systems including Solaris.

Version 2.3 (2002-04-05)

 - New "Dead Keys" panel added.  Which can be used to enter Latin
   characters with accent symbol in double stroke.

 - More localized keyboard layout: Belgian, Danish, French,
   German, Icelandic, Italian, Japanese (JIS-X-6004), Norwegian,
   Portuguese, Spanish, Swedish, Swiss/German, United Kingdom and
   Latin-1.

 - -keypad option would crash previous version of xvkbd - this
   problem is now fixed.

Version 2.4 (2002-10-02)

 - Command can now be assigned to function keys so that clicking
   on the function key will execute the command instead of
   sending the string to clients.

 - Assigned string for F1 to F12 with Shift modifier can now be
   edited on a panel popped up via "Edit Function Keys..." in the
   main menu.

Version 2.5 (2002-10-12)

 - Quick Modifier feature added - now, it is possible to enter
   characters with modifiers by pressing a key and then move the
   pointer.  (suggested by Niklas Rokaeus)

 - ``Lock AltGr?'' entry is added in the main menu.

 - Status of ``Lock Shift?'', ``Lock AltGr'', ``Lock Control, Alt
   and Meta?'' will be recorded in $HOME/.xvkbd file and it will
   be read when xvkbd is invoked next time.

Version 2.5a (2003-06-25)

 - ``Fitaly'' layout is now supported - may be useful for PDAs.

Version 2.6 (2004-05-04)

 - Code to adding keysyms which were not found in the keymap
   table is revised.  xvkbd now avoid to add keysyms in the shifted
   position of keys which already have a keysym defined in the
   non-shifted position, and entries in the keymap table which is
   modified keys will be redefined rather than redefining the
   entire keymap table.  This change is to avoid possible problem
   (AltGr key could be effectively disabled) which may caused in
   some systems where XGetKeyboardMapping() can produce incorrect
   map when keys have more then two keysyms.

 - If Mode_switch is not defined in the modifier table but
   ISO_Level3_Shift is defined, xvkbd now attempt to add
   Mode_switch as the same modifier with ISO_Level3_Shift.

 - Korean layout is now supported.  Although Hangul characters
   will be displayed on the keys, xvkbd will simply generate
   alphabet characters when those keys are clicked.  It is
   intented to be used with "ami" or similar Hangul input
   program.

 - URL of the xvkbd main page is now changes to
   http://t-sato.in.coocan.jp/xvkbd/.

Version 2.7 (2005-05-05)

 - Yet another Japanese keyboard layout, JIS X 6002, is now
   supported.

 - It is now possible to minimize (iconify) the main window even
   if no window manager is in use.  This feature can be activated
   by -minimizable option or xvkbd.minimizable resource.

 - Experimental code to keep the xvkbd window always on the top of
   the display.  This feature can be activated by -always-on-top
   option, xvkbd.alwaysOnTop resource or the "Always on Top?"
   entry in the main menu.  Care should be taken as this feature
   can cause problem in some situations.

 - -text option now support combinations of modifiers and a special
   key.  For example, -text '\C\A\d' can be used for Control-Alt-
   Delete key combination.

 - New options: -secure option (xvkbd.secure resource) which
   disables invocation of external commands, -nonexitable option
   (xvkbd.nonexitable resource) which inhibits termination of the
   program, and -xdm option which is equivalent to -secure
   -nonexitable and maybe useful when run xvkbd from a display
   manager.

Version 2.7a (2005-05-07)

 - Fixed a problem that xvkbd could cause segmentation fault on
   startup.

Version 2.8 (2006-09-10)

 - ISO_Level3_Shift is now to be prefered over Mode_switch so
   that AltGr can be used on relatively new systems where we must
   use ISO_Level3_Shift instead of Mode_switch.

 - Reference to the target bitmap is changed from
   /usr/X11R6/include/X11/bitmaps/target to /usr/include/X11/bitmaps/target.

 - New options: -no-back-pointer, -no-sync, -modifiers.

Version 2.9 (2008-03-30)

 - Russian (Cyrillic) keyboard layout supported. (thanks, Victor)

 - New -delay option.

 - \D special sequence in -text can be used to put a delay in
   specific position.

 - -text can now simulate mouse operation via \x, \y and \m special
    sequences.

Version 3.0 (2008-05-05)

 - New Property panel.

 - New automatic click feature.

 - Key-click sounds when key is pressed.

Version 3.1 (2010-01-17)

 - Changed the default setting for automatic click to OFF, which
   was set ON in the previous release in error and caused confu-
   sion.

 - The keypad is now customizable, too (see XVkbd-strip.ad for
   the example).

 - Up to 25x25 keys can now be supported both for the main keyboard
   and the keypad.

 - Able to open the keypad panel when startup, by setting
   `xvkbd.keypad: false' and `xvkbd.keypadOnly: true'.

 - Fixed errors in some keyboard layout files (Korean, Slovene,
   UK).

 - A new sample layout file XVkbd-strip.ad.

Version 3.2 (2010-03-14)

 - New option `Behave as Toolbar Window?' on the Property panel,
   which may make xvkbd works better with some kind of window
   managers such as Matchbox window manager. (Thanks, Patrick)

   which support extended window manager hint
   _NET_WM_STATE_ABOVE.

 - -window option can now find window which have title match with
   the specified string.

 - -window option now accept wildcard characters `*' and `?'.

 - Word completion dictionary file to be used with `Word Completion...'
   can now be specified on the Property panel.

 - Only the words which have two or more characters will be
   appeared in the word completion list.

 - New -version option to display version information.

Version 3.3 (2012-03-03)

 - -text can now accept \{keysym} so that the specified key can
   be processed in more primitive manner, and so that modofier
   keys such as Control_L, Meta_L, etc.  can also be simulated.
   Also, \{+keysym} and \{-keysym} will now simulate press and
   release of the key, respectively.

 - New option -remote-display to make xvkbd connect to the specified
   display when startup.

 - Bug fixed: KP_0 now works.

Version 3.4 (2013-03-31)

 - I hope code to manipulate keys assigned in AlgrGr and Shift-AltGr
   positions are now fixed.  (Thanks, Paul)

 - Default value of xvkbd.textDelay is now set to 10, as it seems
   delay of 0 caused problems in some situations.

 - ISO_Left_Tab is assigned to the shifted position of the Tab
   key on the xvkbd window, so that Shift-Tab can be simulated.

 - New option -no-resize to disable resize of xvkbd window.

Version 3.5 (2013-07-15)

   This bug is now fixed.

Version 3.8 (2017-06-06)

 - When lower-case letters of xvkbd window are clicked while Caps
   Lock on the physical keyboard is on, by temporary toggling the
   Caps Lock status, xvkbd now try to generate lower-case letters
   rather than upper-case letters.

 - If keyboard layout other than Default is selected, text
   assigned to function keys would  be lost.  This bug is now
   fixed.

 - When German keymap is selected, after Shift key on the physical
   keyboard is pressed, xvkbd would generate "y" instead of "z"
   (and so on).  A workaround for this problem is now implemented.

 - xvkbd sometimes caused an error "X Error of failed request:
   BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation) /
   Major opcode of failed request: 12 (X_ConfigureWindow)" and
   failed to start.  A workaround for this problem is now implemented.

Version 3.9 (2018-02-25)

     when Integrate Completion Panel? on the Property panel set on.

   - xvkbd will insert blank (' ') automatically between words,
     when Insert Blank after Completion? on the Property panel set on.

  - Modifier "Super" (keysym Super_L and Super_R) is now supported,
    although it is not on the supplied keyboard layouts.

    Modifier "Super" can be expressed as "\W" in -text option.

  - Modifiers did not work correctly before first key is pressed.
    This problem is fixed.

  - To build, "./configure" may be used instead of "xmkmf".


Version 4.1 (2020-05-04)

 - xvkbd-4.0 couldn't read word list without frequency information.
   This bug is not fixed.

 - Too slow startup if word list file is large.
   This problem is now fixed by making xvkbd to read large word list file
   on the fly.

 - Modified Makefile.am to add prefix $(DESTDIR) to the destination path.

 - Fixed duplicate definition problem of variable appres.
