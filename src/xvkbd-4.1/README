NAME
       xvkbd - virtual keyboard for X window system

DESCRIPTION
       xvkbd is a virtual (graphical) keyboard program for X Window System
       which provides a facility to enter characters onto other clients
       (software) by clicking on a keyboard displayed on the screen.  This
       may be used for systems without a hardware keyboard such as kiosk
       terminals or handheld devices.  This program also has a facility to
       send characters specified as the command line option to another
       client.

       The standard keyboard layout is based on the traditional US layout,
       but some other keyboard layout (see "Screenshot") are also sup-
       ported.  The default window size may be too large for systems with
       small screen, but it can be configured to use smaller space (220x90
       pixels, for example).  For details, see also "Screenshot" and "How
       to Customize xvkbd" below, and resouce files in the distribution.

       xvkbd version 2.1 and later support word completion and xvkbd ver-
       sion 4.0 and later will now learns the used words for word comple-
       tion , which may make it easier to enter long words with xvkbd.

       IMPORTANT NOTE: When invoking xvkbd from display managers such as
       XDM, GDM, etc., always use xvkbd with -secure option or you will
       have serious security risk.

Environment
       xvkbd will work on X11R5 or X11R6.  It is tested on redhat Linux and
       Solaris, and it will work also on most UNIX-like systems.

       This program uses Xaw (use of Xaw3d is recommended) and no special
       library is required.

Operation
    Input Keys
       When xvkbd is started, the image of a keyboard will be displayed on
       the screen.  Clicking any key on the xvkbd window will send the
       character to the focused window as if the key had been actually
       typed with the hardware keyboard.

       If you want to input upper-case alphabets or other characters on the
       upper position on the keyboard, you should click the key after
       selecting Shift by clicking it, or click the key with mouse button 3
       (maybe right button) or mouse button 4.  In the similar manner, if
       you want to input Controled characters, you should click the key
       after clicking Control, or click the key with mouse button 2 (maybe
       middle button).  Alt and Meta can be used in the similar manner with
       Control, but there are no shortcuts with mouse buttons.

    ``Quick Modifiers''
       xvkbd 2.5 and later support another way to input characters with
       modifiers such as Shift, Control, AltGr, etc., which may be useful
       especially for machines with touch panels such as PDAs - we would
       call it "Quick Modifiers".

       Quick Modifiers can be enabled/disabled by the ``Enable "Quick Modi-
       fiers?'' entry on the property panel.  If Quick Modifiers is
       enabled, it will be activated by pressing a key on the xvkbd window,
       move the pointer outside of the key, and then release the mouse but-
       ton or equivalent.

       The direction of the pointer motion will select the modifier:

             up        - Shift
             right     - AltGr
             right-up  - Shift AltGr
             left      - Control
             left-up   - Shift Control
             down      - Meta
             left-down - Alt

    Setting Input Focus
       If you are using a window manager and clients where you can set
       input focus by clicking mouse button on the window (and you don't
       have to keep pointer in the window after that), you can simply set
       input focus in the normal way and then click keys on the xvkbd win-
       dow - the character will be sent to the selected position.

       If you are using a window manager or clients where you must keep the
       pointer in the input field to input from the keyboard, or if the
       input focus is switched to the xvkbd window when you clicked on the
       key on the xvkbd window, you must make xvkbd to set input focus
       explicitly by clicking the Focus button on the xvkbd window and then
       click on the input field.  This input focus can be cleared by click-
       ing Focus button with mouse button 3, or simply clicking Focus but-
       ton twice.

    Word Completion
       Choosing ``Word Completion...'' in the main menu will popup the Word
       Completion panel.

       When you entered characters by clicked keys on the xvkbd window as
       usual while the Word Completion panel open, words started with the
       characters will be listed in the panel, and you can enter the
       remaining characters of the selected word by clicking one of the
       words in the list.

         When ``Integrate Completion Panel?'' on the property panel is set
       on,
         completion panel will be displayed on the main window when
       required.
         .PP The dictionary (list of words) file is
       /usr/share/xvkbd/words.english by default, but it can be changed
       with Static Dictionary on the property panel.

         In addition, xvkbd records the used words and those scores in
       $HOME/.xvkbd.words.

    Main Menu
       Pressing the ``xvkbd'' logo on the main keyboard (placed near left-
       bottom corner in the default configuration) will popup the main
       menu.

       The menu contains following items:

       About...
           Show short description of this program.

       Manual...
           Launch manual page reader.

           German, Icelandic, Italian, Japanese (JIS-X-6002), Japanese
           (JIS-X-6004), Korean, Norwegian, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish,
           Swedish, Swiss/German, United Kingdom and Latin-1 are available.

       Edit Function Keys...
           Open a popup window to edit string assigned to function keys.
           See also "Assigning Text to Function Keys".

       Show Keypad?
           Toggle show/hide of the keypad on the main window.

       Show Function Keys?
           Toggle show/hide of the function keys on the main window.

       Property...
           Popup the Property panel.

       Connect to Remote Display...
           Open a panel to specify the name of a remote display (in the
           meaning of the X Window System) to connect, so that following
           key events will be sent to windows on the remote display.

       Revert to Local Display
           Disconnect from the remote display so that following key events
           will be sent to windows on the local display.

    Property Panel
       Enable "Quick Modifiers"?
           Toggle enable/disable of the Quick Modifiers feature.

       Lock Shift?
           Toggle locking/momentary of Shift keys.

           Toggle locking/momentary of AltGr key.

       Lock Control, Alt and Meta?
           Toggle locking/momentary of Control, Alt and Meta keys.

       Always on Top?
           If this entry is set ON, xvkbd attempts to keep the xvkbd window
           always on the top of the display (i.e. not to be hidden by other
           windows).  This feature is experimental, and care should be
           taken as this feature can cause problem in some situations.

       Behave as Toolbar Window?
           xvkbd attempts to be a toolbar window when it is used with some
           kind of window managers such as Matchbox window manager.

       Use XTEST Extension?
           XTEST extension will be used if this entry is checked.  If this
           entry is set inactive, the X server does not support XTEST
           extension.

       Jump Pointer?
           If this entry is set ON, xvkbd will temporary jump the pointer
           to the focused window, if XTEST extension is to be used to simu-
           late keyboard events.

       Key-Click Sound
           Set on/off and duration of key-click sound.

       Automatic Click
           Set on/off of the automatic click feature and the delay before
           automatic click is activated.  If this feature is set, xvkbd
           will work as if left mouse button is clicked when mouse pointer
           is moved on a button and stays long enough.  You may want to set
           Jump Pointer? to OFF to avoid auto-repeating.

       Completion:

         Static Dictionary
             Set the filename to be used for word completion.
               This setting take precedence over the `xvkbd.dictFile'
           resource
               and the -dict option.
               Default: /usr/share/xvkbd/words.english

         Dynamic Dictionary Weight
                 This parameter controls "learning" of recently used words.
               When this value is set 0, xvkbd will not learn used words.
               With higher value setting, xvkbd will quickly
               learn the used words and effectively ignores frequency
           information
               in the Static Dictionary.
               Default: 1.

         Insert Blank after Completion?"
                 If this button is set on,
               xvkbd will insert blank (' ') automatically after word com-
           pletion
               if the next character is not blank nor punctuations.

         Integrate Completion Panel?"
                 If this button is set on,
               word completion panel will be inegrated at top of the main
           window
               and will be activated when required.

    Options
       xvkbd accept following command line options, in addition to general
       options such as `-display'.

       -version
           Display version information and exit.

       -xsendevent
           Make xvkbd to use XSendEvent() to simulate keyboard events, as
           it was in xvkbd version 1.0.  xvkbd version 1.1 and later will
           try to use XTEST extension instead in the default configuration.
           Because it is not unusual applications to ignore keyboard events
           generated with -xsendevent, you shouldn't use -xsendevent option
           unless it is really required.
           If XTEST extension is not supported by the X server, xvkbd will
           automatically switch to this mode.
           Resource `xvkbd.xtest: false' has the same function.

       -no-sync
           Normally, xvkbd attempts to synchronize with the destinating
           client step by step.  This can cause problem when the client (or
           the X server) responded too slow.  In such situation, maybe this
           -no-sync can solve the problem.
           Resource `xvkbd.noSync: true' has the same function.

       -no-jump-pointer
           Make xvkbd not to jump the pointer when sending events.  In the
           default, xvkbd will temporary jump the pointer to the focused
           window, if input focus is set explicitly via Focus button, and
           XTEST extension is to be used to simulate keyboard events.
           Resource `xvkbd.jumpPointer: false' has the same function.

       -no-back-pointer
           Make xvkbd not to jump the pointer back to the original position
           after events has been sent.  Maybe this can be useful when using
           xvkbd to move the pointer position.
           Resource `xvkbd.jumpPointerBack: false' has the same function.

       -modal
           Make labels on keys in the xvkbd window to be set independently
           for each of four shift states, not shifted, Shift, AltGr and
           Shift-AltGr.  This is useful when you want to make the xvkbd
           window very small.
           See also "Customizing Keyboard Layout" and resouce files in the
           distribution.
           Resource `xvkbd.modalKeytop: true' has the same function.

       -geometry  [widthxheight][+xoff+yoff]
           Set window geometry (size and position).
           You can use form like -geometry 400x130 to specify the window
           size, -geometry +100+100 to specify the window position from
           left/top edge of the screen, and -geometry 400x130+100+100 to
           specify both the size and the position.  You can specify posi-
           tion from right/bottom edge of the screen by using - instead of
           +, but please note that you must take account of size of the
           window border.  (If you specify `-geometry -0-0', the window
           will not fit in the screen.)
           This can be set by xvkbd.windowGeometry resource (note that it
           is not xvkbd.geometry), too.

       -no-resize
           Disable resize of the xvkbd window.
           Resource `xvkbd.resizable: false' has the same function.

       -no-repeat
           Do not auto-repeat even if key is depressed long time.
           If auto-repeat is enabled (this is the default), time before
           start auto-repeat can be set as `xvkbd*Repeater.initialDelay:
           600', and period of repeat can be set as `xvkbd*Repeater.mini-
           mumDelay: 100' (unit of there parameters are milli-seconds).
           Resource `xvkbd.autoRepeat: false' has the same function.

       -no-functionkey
           Do not display function keys.
           Resource `xvkbd.functionkey: false' has the same function.

       -no-keypad
           Do not display keypad.
           Resource `xvkbd.keypad: false' has the same function.

       -compact
           Do not display function keys nor keypad.
           Resource `xvkbd.compact: true' has the same function.

       -keypad
           Display only keypad.  This option will be ignored if `-no-key-
           pad' or `-compact' is specified.
           Resource `xvkbd.keypadOnly: true' has the same function.

       -text string
           Send the string to the focused window (see also `-window'
           option).
           If this option is specified, xvkbd will not open its window and
           terminate soon after sending the string.
           The string can contain:

           - \r - Return

           - \t - Tab

           - \b - Backspace

           - \e - Escape

           - \d - Delete

           - \S - Shift (modify the next character; please note that modify
             with ``\S'' will be ignored in many cases.  For example,
             ``a\Cb\ScD\CE'' will be interpreted as a, Control-b, c, Shift-
             D, and Control-Shift-E.)

           - \C - Control (modify the next character)

           - \A - Alt (modify the next character)

           - \M - Meta (modify the next character)

           - \W - Super (modify the next character)
               .IP "    - " 6 \[keysym] - the keysym keysym (e.g.,
             \[Left]), which will be processed in the similar matter with
             other general characters

           - \{keysym} - the keysym keysym (e.g., \{Left}), which will be
             processed in more primitive matter and can also be used for
             modofier keys such as Control_L, Meta_L, etc.; also,
             \{+keysym} and \{-keysym} will simulate press and release of
             the key, respectively

           - \Ddigit - delay digit * 100 ms

           - \xvalue - move mouse pointer (use "+" or "-" for relative
             motion)

           - \yvalue - move mouse pointer (use "+" or "-" for relative
             motion)

           - \mdigit - simulate click of the specified mouse button

       -file filename
           Send the contents of the specified file to the focused window
           (see also `-window' option).  If ``-'' was specified as the
           filename, string to be sent will be read from the standard input
           (stdin).
           If this option is specified, xvkbd will not open its window and
           terminate soon after sending the string.

       -utf16
           When used with -file option, make xvkbd to accept UTF16 charac-
           ters in the file.

       -delay value
           Put value ms of delay for evey characters when sending charac-
           ters with -text or -file.  Maybe this is useful when problem
           arises when characters are entered too fast.
           Resource `xvkbd.textDelay: value' has the same function.

       -window window
           Specify the ID (hexadecimal value leaded with `0x', or decimal
           value), the name (instance name or class name) of the window, or
           the title of the window to set input focus.  It is possible to
           use wildcard characters `*' and `?'  to match the window name or
           the window title.
           If this is not specified, xvkbd will use input focus under con-
           trol of the window manager, unless focus is specified explicitly
           via Focus button.  Even if this option is specified, you can set
           input focus to other windows using Focus button, or clear the
           input focus.
           If there are two or more windows which have the name specified
           with this option, the window which was found first will be
           selected.

       -widget widget-name
           Specify the name of the widget to set the input focus.  To use
           this feature, the client must support Editres protocol.  In gen-
           eral, this option will be used with `-window' option.
           If you want to set input focus to the widget foo.bar.zot, you
           can write zot, bar.zot or foo.bar.zot as widget-name.  To avoid
           confusion, the widget-name should match with a single widget of
           the client.
           For example,

               xvkbd -window xarchie -widget searchText -text "\Ca\Ckabc\r"

           will enter the string ``abc'' to the ``Search Term'' field of a
           xarchie window.

       -remote-display display
           Specify the display (in the meaning of the X Window System) to
           connect;
             see also Connect to Remote Display....

       -true-keypad
           If this option is specified, xvkbd will attempt to use keysyms
           such as XK_KP_1 instead of XK_1.
           Resource `xvkbd.keypadKeysym: true' has the same function.

       -dict filename
           Specify the default dictionary (list of words) file to be used
           for word completion.  The `Completion Dictionary' filename set
           on the Property panel takes precedence over this.
           Resource `xvkbd.dictFile: filename' has the same function.
           See also ``Making your own completion dictionary''.

       -minimizable
           Make xvkbd window can be minimized (iconified) even if no window
           manager is in use.  When this feature is enabled, small triangle
           will be displayed at left ot the xvkbd main menu, and xvkbd win-
           dow will be minimized when the triangle is clicked.
           Resource `xvkbd.minimizable: true' has the same function.

       -secure
           Disable invocation of external commands, including user assigned
           command and the online manual reader.  Connection to another
           displays would also be disabled.  This option may be useful when
           xvkbd is to be run with some kind of privileges.
           Resource `xvkbd.secure: true' has the same function.

       -nonexitable
           Disable termination of the xvkbd program.  This option may be
           useful when xvkbd is to be run automatically for systems with no
           keyboards and users should not terminate the xvkbd.
           Resource `xvkbd.nonexitable: true' has the same function.

       -xdm
           Same as -secure -nonexitable.  When xvkbd is to be run for login
           screen, it would be suggested to use this option.

       -modifiers modifiers
           Normally, xvkbd will activate modifiers (control, shift, etc.)
           only while sending characters.  If modifiers were specified with
           this option, the specified modifiers will be activated while
           corresponding key on the xvkbd window is in active.  For exam-
           ple, you can specify -modifiers shift,control,meta,alt to apply
           this for those four modifiers.  Maybe this can be useful when
           attempting to decorate the mouse operations with the modifiers.
           Please note that the modifiers will also be applied when
           attempting to click on the xvkbd window and which can prevent
           the correct operation in some situations.

       License.

Install
    xmkmf
         o untar the source in a directory, and move to the directory

         o If you wish to use genuine Xaw instead of Xaw3d, edit Imakefile
           and remove (or comment-out) `#define XAW3D'.
           When you are installing xvkbd (for example) in very old systems,
           you may also want to remove `#define XTEST' and `#define I18N'
           to disable XTEST and internationalization facility respectively.

         o Run: xmkmf; make install install.man

    configure
       Alternatively, maybe you can:

         o untar the source in a directory, and move to the directory

         o Run: ./configure; make; make install

Customization
    How to Customize xvkbd
       Some degree of customization of xvkbd is possible by setting
       resources.  Some resources are already described above, and
       resources to customizing keyboard layout are described below.

       To set resources, you can:

         o put them in your $HOME/.Xdefaults file, or

         o load them via xrdb(1), or

         o set the filename to the $XENVIRONMENT environment variable, or

         o put them in application default directory as `XVkbd-suffix' and
           set resource ``xvkbd.customization: -suffix'', or

         o put them in application default directory as XVkbd.

       Here, application default directory can be either of:

         o directories specified with $XUSERFILESEACHPATH, $XAPPLRESDIR or
           else $HOME environment variable

         o system's application default directory specified with $XFILE-
           SEACHPATH environment variable, or else the directory specified
           when compiling the X (e.g., /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults)

       When the application default file is to be stored in the system's
       application default directory, the file must contain ``#include
       "XVkbd-common"'' near top of the file.

       xvkbd is distributed with some application default files, and they
       will be installed in the system's application default directory.

    Making Window Small
       Size (and position) of xvkbd window can be set by `xvkbd.windowGeom-
       etry' resource.  When making window small, you may need to choose
       the smaller font, too.

             xvkbd.windowGeometry: 220x90
             xvkbd.compact: true
             xvkbd*Font: 6x12

       You may also want to set:

             xvkbd.modalKeytop: true

       to display only the labels for the current shift state, instead of
       trying to always display all of them in the small keytop.

       See also XVkbd-small.ad in the xvkbd distribution.

    Removing Unwanted Keys
       Keys on xvkbd window can be removed by setting their width to 1.
       The resource name of the keys that start with a capital letter (and
       of the space key) is the same as the key itself, the others are of
       the form <row>,<col> (counting from zero).

       To remove Compose key and make Shift key larger, you can write:

             xvkbd*Multi_key.width: 1
             xvkbd*Shift_R.width: 75

       To remove right Alt and Meta key, you can write:

             xvkbd*Alt_R.width: 1
             xvkbd*Meta_R.width: 1

    Customizing Keyboard Layout
       Layout of keys on the xvkbd window can be customized with following
       resources:

       xvkbd.NormalKeys
           list of keys available when neighter of Shift and AltGr are
           selected

       xvkbd.ShiftKeys
           list of keys available when Shift is selected

       xvkbd.AltgrKeys
           list of keys available when AltGr is selected

       xvkbd.ShiftAltgrKeys
           list of keys available when both AltGr and Shift are selected

       xvkbd.KeyLabels
           list of labels displayed on the keys

       xvkbd.NormalKeyLabels
           list of labels displayed on the keys
             when neither of Shift and AltGr are selected.

       xvkbd.ShiftKeyLabels
           list of labels displayed on the keys
             when Shift is selected

       xvkbd.AltgrKeyLabels
           list of labels displayed on the keys
             when AltGr is selected

       xvkbd.ShiftAltgrKeyLabels
           list of labels displayed on the keys
             when both AltGr and Shift are selected

       Four resources to set labels on the keys (xvkbd.NormalKeyLabels,
       xvkbd.ShiftKeyLabels, xvkbd.AltgrKeyLabels and xvkbd.ShiftAltgrKey-
       Labels) will be used instead of xvkbd.KeyLabels when xvkbd.modalKey-
       top resoruce is set true.

       In all of those resources, each keys are separated by spaces, and
       rows of keys are terminated with ` \n\' (note that `\n' must have
       space before it).  Please refer XVkbd-german.ad and XVkbd-latin1.ad
       in the xvkbd distribution for more about these resources.

       XVkbd-german and XVkbd-latin1 will be installed in the system's
       application default directory, and setting the resource ``xvkbd.cus-
       tomization: -german'' will make xvkbd to use the German layout.  For
       another method to activate those settings, please refer "How to Cus-
       tomize xvkbd" above.

    Assigning Text to Function Keys
       Text can be assigned to each function keys (and, actually, to most
       other keys).  If text is assigned to the function key, clicking on
       the key will send the assigned text instead of the function key
       itself.  When pointer is on a key where text is assigned, the text
       will be displayed near the key.

       The setting will be read from a text file which contains text for
       each function keys as:

             F1 text for F1
             F2 text for F2
             s:F1 text for Shift-F1
             c:F1 text for Control-F1
             m:F1 text for Meta-F1
             a:F1 text for Alt-F1
             ...

       `s:', `c:', `m:' and `a:' before the keys name indicates four modi-
       fiers (Shift, Control, Meta and Alt) respectively.

       If the first character of the assigned string is `!', the string
       will be used as command to be executed when the key is clicked.  To
       assign string starting with `!' or `\', put `\' before the string.

       The file is $HOME/.xvkbd in default, and it can be changed by set-
       ting the filename with xvkbd.keyFile resource.

       For F1 to F12 with or without Shift modifier, it is possible to edit
       the assigned string on a panel popped up via "Edit Function Keys..."
       in the main menu.

Miscellaneous Informations
    Notes
         o On XFree86, resolution switch with Ctrl + Alt + Keypad-Plus and
           Ctrl + Alt + Keypad-Minus may be simulated.  However, Ctrl + Alt
           + Backspace will not be simulated.

         o Shift is used to decide key to be sent and it will not used to
           set modifier bit when sending the event.  You can use xev com-
           mand to check what is actually sent.

         o If Alt or Meta is not defined as modifier, the key can't be used
           as modifier.  You can use `xmodmap -pm' to check how modifiers
           are defined.

         o Num Lock (and maybe other modifiers) on the physical keyboard
           may not work correctly when xvkbd is in use.

         o After updated from xvkbd-3.x to xvkbd-4.x, you may need to reset
           the completion dictionary by clicking "Default" button after
           "Static Dictionary:" in the xvkbd's property panel.

         o Known Bug: xvkbd-4.0 can no longer read dictonary file without
           frequency information, such as /usr/share/dict/words.  I will
           fix this problem in the next release.
